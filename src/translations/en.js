    aboutText1: "As part of PDA's objective to advocate for the protection of children in Ghana, the organization developed an online platform that tracks cases of child abuse published in the newspapers and prominent online portals. The progress of these cases are also monitored in order to advocate for further intervention where necessary.",
    aboutText2: "Research shows that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the real abuses children face. Majority of the cases go unreported, and the victims live with the posttraumatic experiences that accompany such abuses. Sadly, even with the cases reported, justice still remains a distant possibility.",
